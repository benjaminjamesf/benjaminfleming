Group assignments once made me feel like I was being penalised week one (bless the collective sigh when some tutor edicts that groups are random), but after working in some crash hot teams I’ve entered the light and now see how they’re a necessity. Our team had worked together before and we were into our dynamic – spending twilight hours together was fun even when it wasn’t. We knew we had many of those hours ahead, making for an easy decision to take on the Interaction Design studio together.</p>

                        <p>Tasked with delivering a team charter, we agreed upon some ground rules:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Oliver from Mobile Experience lead our class on rapid sketching and ideation, seeing us sketch out a variety of doors in exploration of how each is the same object which solves a different problem. He emphasised that iteration of ideas lead to novel designs and better products through a constant idea generation and refinement process. This lead to us scoping out the current state of things in autonomous vehicles, researching the current who’s who and what’s, and generating some early ideas of products we’d like to design interfaces for.</p>

                        <p>To narrow down our brainstorming session we first devised a set of overarching groups of services in a city environment like Accessibility, Transport and Safety. This was to give a bit of structure to our ideas and help us avoid the initial blank page effect. We went around the table and put down anything we could think of, spitballing of each other and linking related concepts. This gave us a valuable way to assess where each member wanted to take our project and culminated in three concepts we wanted to pursue: </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><b>An autonomous high speed autobahn: </b>a high speed vehicle corridor linking Eastern Australian cities and regional hubs, replacing our reliance on domestic flights. This could either be a specialised corridor where passengers used their own private vehicles that became autonomous upon entering the highway to achieve high speeds or a transit-stop type approach with stations in cities like a personalised train service. </li>
                            <li><b>Autonomous fast food delivery robots:</b> a modular fleet of delivery carts for big chain fast food companies with compartments and features that can be customised according to the businesses needs. We were interested in exploring how the interfaces of each element would interplay (specifically from a customer, store employee, and enterprise facing contexts) with each other and the carts functionalities at massive scale.</li>
                            <li><b>Modular public transport systems:</b> Uber Pool’s arrival in Australia highlighted that public transit systems in high density urban areas may not be serving their residents as well as they could. We wondered if creating smaller and faster methods of transit for city passengers headed in similar directions could work and how interfaces that needed to be used by any and all members of the public would need to be designed.</li>

                        <p>After researching different aspects of our proposed ideas we chose the autobahn idea as our chosen concept to create. We felt it had the most impact and potential in changing the way future cities would transport people. Governments had already considered constructing a high speed rail line between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, and the Sydney > Melbourne flight path is the second busiest route in the world. Airplane travel is notoriously unfriendly to the environment and its use is growing much faster than our ability to innovate on how it is fuelled.</p>

                        <p>Urbanisation and lack of housing are pertinent problems in Australian cities: we all flock to eastern capitals, negatively impacting the environment, causing major housing stress and gentrification thus deepening class divides. We move to these cities for a variety of benefits - what if they were easier to access and did not require you to live in a 2000 - 2400 postcode? A green corridor of autonomous vehicles could allow Australians to own a home (currently a pipe dream for 99% of us) in a regional centre and still commute to work or school in the CBD without the negative impacts.

                        <p>In order for us to realise this concept to interface for, we first had to understand who we were designing for. Under Oliver’s direction we used the internet and our knowledge to populate a stakeholder map of all the possible actors in our concepts domain. This was to help us formulate a research plan for the first stage of our project by allowing us to select participants we could easily access to study.

                        <p>We also began talking our concept through with our peers to gather feedback on it’s validity and scope how others generally thought about it. Our lecturer Hamish loved the concept and how we had come to a considered choice so soon - he could clearly see its potential. However Sophie (our tutor(hi lol!)) felt quite the opposite. She too loved that we were focused on getting a solution but felt we were jumping right to the end of the process way way too early - if we had a solution already then we were headed in the wrong direction.
                        </p>

                        <p>We both did not want to pigeonhole ourselves and achieve non-novel designs from the outset. Sophie emphasised that as designers we shouldn’t be diving straight into an idea that anyone on the street could just conjure up, we needed to find and understand a problem before we spurt solutions. We immediately knew her advice to be correct. So we scrapped our solution and opened the floor to a space we’d be passionate exploring (properly this time). </p>

                        <p> We approached this in much the same way as our first concept map: what problems do we face in Sydney that we assume others face to? We quickly realised that as privileged inner city kids - we may not be the best people to ask. Rather than draw problems outta our minds by sheer force, we looked at Government policies. As the parties are elected by Australian people, we felt they’d at least know a little bit about broad problems they face (even if they didn’t intend on actually doing anything about them). We devised three “problem themes” from our earlier solution and then drew out the areas from there. </p>

                        <p>We did this to see which stakeholders we could access to perform research activities. Domestic violence (DV) is a broad, multi-faceted issue, there are many different services and people collaborating together. Hendrik Mueller, a user researcher from Google lead our tutorial on research methods, explaining that a triangulated approach of techniques that were valid and reliable yielded the best results. </p>

                        <p>We selected participants in the same approach: I would be focusing on social workers and crisis support services. Nathan would be looking at the police and Bethany at victim and homelessness support centres. </p>

                        <p>Our groups research objective: To assess and understand the factors involved with domestic violence in Sydney. To achieve this we individually devised a set of research questions we sought to answer. As I was targeting social services, I wanted to know the status quo of the sector and gain an insider understanding:

                        <p>Government policy makers had made jobs like hers nigh impossible over the past decade, creating violent feedback loops that simultaneously created, exacerbated and refused to solve the domestic violence phenomena.

She had given me an invaluable firsthand account of the scenario at hand and a lot to think about. </p>

                        <p>We attempted to map out the roles and processes involved in responding to domestic violence. This was not an easy feat - we had so much research to sift through and the different stakeholders were in competition. </p>

                        <p> As we each covered different aspects (like the police and social workers) we were kind’ve role playing the areas we covered, arguing and explaining our actors issues as them. When we noticed this we took it a step further and added our personas into the mix and forcibly roleplayed as them which allowed us to deepen this explanation and be more empathetic towards each other. Our goal with this activity was to get everyone on the one page and to generate concepts we’d like to pursue. We were definitely on the one whiteboard but we quickly became frustrated with our early ideas.</p>

                        <h4>They were either too narrow and garnered isolated benefits or far too broad and could be applicable to the general population.</h4>

                        <p>Some of them even bordered on sexist - we were generating concepts but they just weren’t hitting the mark for us. We didn’t want to have done all of this in depth research to end up with a pedestrian solution. To overcome this creative stagnation, we decided upon the forced association design method to generate a swathe of concepts (no matter how ridiculous). </p>

                        <p>We created a set of stakeholder cards (Social workers, Victims, Courts etc) together and individually created up to thirty vehicle cards. </p>

This alone didn’t help our project - the true <i>a-ha</i> moment came from meeting up again and analysing what we had come up with. After discussing all of our work - we analysed what we’d created and looked at trends in our thinking, novel ideas and laughed at silly ones.

                        <p>The social worker assistant bot was my concept to develop and test. It was also my personal hero concept - having witnessed social worker officers at their place of work had really cemented their need for a technological solution that made sense to them. Their existing tools were not needs focused and were developed by the government for all social enterprises. This meant they were painting all services and their employees with the same brush, broadly solving <i>some</i> problems, but lacking any ability to modularize use for differing service types or encompass the diversity of actors utilizing it. They desperately need tools that intersect with their current workflows without a burden - anything new in this low-tech space cannot add another layer of work to an already underfunded & understaffed service. </p>

                        <p>I sketched out possible interface concepts for the social worker bot based on my own experiences with process-based enterprise CRM software. I knew from my research that mobile app use is on the upward trend with social workers and that high fidelity apps like Uber and Facebook proliferated the screens of their personal lives - they were used to premium experiences and had high expectations of mobile applications. I wanted to offer a hi-def experience and change their perception of what an enterprise software had to look like.</p>

                        <h2>Secure Housing Bus!</h2>

                        <p> In unison! Finally. Why this choice? We agreed the software side of the social worker assistant was sick - it was just hampered by the fact that its vehicular element was essentially a printer on wheels. Our peers understood the software but baulked at how ridiculous it looked. Before it’s time. </p>

                        <p>The maintenance cart as a product was amazing - it just didn’t fit well in our product space and came off as a more premium service of the future. I also struggled with its lightly sexist undertones when applied in our problem space. Again - it’s vehicle-ness was a product that didn’t need wheels, on wheels. </p>

                        <p>Initially we were wary of the secure housing bus - it was one of the first concepts we thought of, and it was seemingly a pedestrian approach to the problem. However - conceptually it made perfect sense to users. We enjoyed designing multiple interfaces for different contexts that worked in harmony.</p>

                        <p> It also performed the strongest in the user evaluation, and after performing deeper secondary research we realised we could take our first thought concept and turn it into a laser focused, multi-faceted solution. </p>

                        <p> After some deeper secondary research into the topic we discovered that the bus goes deeper than we thought. I got really into reading affected women's narratives and the analysis of them - in doing so I learnt that police as the response to domestic violence may not be the answer. </p>

                        <p> Police as the first responders to domestic violence brings with it inherent challenges. Women more often than not are unhappy with the way their cases are handled, particularly in the evidence captured by police, timeliness of responses, and the attitudes of first responding officers. Research suggest their approach could deepen distrust of services, reduce the likelihood of conviction and culturally reinforce an idea of “acceptable violence,” cyclically preventing instances of violence and creating cultures that aggravate the issue as whole.</p>

                        <p>ASH would provide a safe space for women unobstructed by police. Women would be more likely to seek help if this response was less aggressive - and we hope to explore ways ASH could actually help this evidence collection process and assist in the conviction of offenders while protecting those who need it.</p>

                        <p> We set out to conduct yet another round of user testing before we began bringing the interface of our concept to pixelated life. I created another set of paper prototypes (neatly this time) and tested them with users to help inform our research troupes high fidelity mockups.</p>

                        <p> After another round of testing on our paper prototypes, we were ready to realize our concepts interface. We ditched the secure housing bus name and gave her a new moniker: <b>ASH</b> (short for <i>Autonomous Secure Housing)</i>. Performing several rounds of testing had given us a wealth of information to go over, yet users were completing our concrete tasks fairly easily. We had iterated a fair amount of times and we were gripping what was and wasn't appropriate for this interface. We also loved creating two interfaces that interact with the one service: one for booking on a mobile application and another for the bus' on board display.</p>

                        <p>Working out how to keep the language and use of these interfaces unified was difficult when we worked apart, but when we brought the two together and worked together they kind've just fell into place.</p>

                        <p>We studied a plethora of current technologies to inform our design - primarily Tesla's iterations on their in car display system, Mercedes Benz' birds-eye view functions on their premium cars, and Google's self driving car's sensor animations. Beth and I accidentally watched some tech enthusiast nerd review Tesla's in car display for a full 28 minutes. Did we learn something? .. Yes. Do we recommend it? If "post-middle age virgin man harps on about innocuous window wiper feature for seven minutes" sounds like your ASMR - jump on in. </p>

                        <p> We used a combination of Sketch, Photoshop and XD to come to our first set of mockups:</p>

                            We then conducted our largest round of user testing with 8 users - before we transformed our wireframes into an interactive prototype, we wanted to know what we would create worked perfectly.

It's been hot folks - below is the output of our square eyes (made in Framer if you asked). The making of this prototype made us learn not to design by committee, unless spending six hours arguing over a fricken BUTTON sounds appealing to you.</p>

                    <p>TLDR; we made an app for victims of domestic violence by listening to the people affected and those helping them. It was a helluva iterative learning process and it made me wanna cry and kiss my group members on the mouth like, seven times. I learnt some mad skills the last ten weeks - you better have enjoyed reading all about it. </p>

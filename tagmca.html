                    <p class="lead">Design an experience for a museum that builds upon the collection that the institution offers. It should improve the visitor experience, fulfil educational goals of the institution, and help the museum engage with new audiences and affirm their relationship with existing ones.

                    <p> Tag MCA’s aim is to shift the perception of the MCA as a solely aesthetic and passive experience to one that visitors view as a leisurely, socially connected environment. We sought to augment this aesthetic experience with interactivity and play so that the museum retains its inspirational and educational qualities in a way that visitors will want to return to with another.
                    </p>

                    <p> We wanted to break down preconceived barriers that guests create; the museum can be a stifling environment that does not enable social leisure and that you need to “know” art to have a good time. We utilised what the MCA already possesses: a breadth of curated modern art content, expansive and self-exploratory indoor exhibition rooms and the striking exterior architecture. </p>
                    <p> This was interweaved with our insights from user research into what visitors require from a place to warrant them to return to conceptualise a digital, tangible experience that emboldens their sociality and makes them want to visit time and time again.

                        <p>The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) was our space of choice - we liked the diversity of its collection and the spatial opportunities its sheer size would give us.</p>

                        <p>To get a feel of how visitors used this space we spent a day shadowing some and taking notes of how they interacted with it and asked others about their experience. </p>

                        <p>We then used this data to create a direct experience storyboard illustrating the current pain points and flow to create a frame of user needs.</p>

                        <p>Our early interviews about the gallery gave our research scope: most who visit the gallery only do so once and then only return in a blue moon. To empathise with the personal and social contexts of these single-visit users we designed a generative research project aimed at mapping out why people went to the art gallery, or rather - why go on an outing at all?

                        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
                        <p>As the goal of the project was to create a digital experience prototype that stakeholders would invest in - we felt the most succint and impactful way to sell it was as a video prototype. We researched the technology required and created a specification for the concept, created a low-fidelity physical prototype & filmed the experience on location at the MCA. We used a blend of After Effects and projectors to emulate the experience in a quick and communicative way. </p>
                        
                        <p>The prototype was presented to some of the members of the generative study and their feedback was used to create a user journey map contrasting the current state and post experience state at the gallery. </p>

                            <h4 class="ml-3">Cultivate an innovative and continuously improving education system which emphasises collaboration between schools and their communities</h4>
                            <br>

                            <p><a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/56341/" target="_blank" class="text-muted">Research projects</a> aimed at equipping our students with these 21st century skills have been hugely successful - but they were not continued commercially due to resource constraints or systemic support.</p>

                            <p> We have kids who are in dire need of an up skill, already strained teachers and schools with scarce resources. You have tertiary students like us who know of this problem first hand and want to make a difference - but how?</p>

                                <h4>Finding a domain</h4>
                                <p>At the beginning of this project our team first researched and generated multiple problem spaces that we could design within. A recurring theme in our thinking was innovation education (or the lack we had individually experienced). After extensive secondary research we found that this was an emerging issue not just for ourselves but for Australiaâ€™s education system. We used generative methods to scope out dozens of solutions in a short time frame.</p>



                                <p>One solution, inspired by recent developments in <a href="https://youtu.be/rpgvmHKbLrE?t=484" target="_blank" class="text-muted"> machine learning supported interactions</a>, was chosen to develop.

                                <p>The school teachers and design educators we pitched to reinvigorated our problem - design theory and innovative thinking are missing from the school system and are necessary for the new business landscape, but they found the proposed solution to be so-so.
                                </p>

                                <p>They were concerned that it targeted upskillers and self educators (our early prototypes and analysis methods lead us to believe that targeting the school system would limit our scalability and that the school sector had too many legislative roadblocks to overcome). The issue was that our current iteration was focused on the wrong facets of the problem - it was tech heavy and lacked an immersive human aspect that this type of education required.</p>

                                <p>This was an eight week design sprint and our project was running dangerously low on time - we were very close to canning the concept and pursuing a simpler domain.</p>
                                <p> In a last attempt to save ourselves starting over, we mapped everything weâ€™d learnt from our interviews and research and then used this to run through multiple iterations of the business model canvas - shifting the core focus of our business in each variation.

                                <p>The partner lead variant of our business model canvas allowed us to reframe the problem and pivot from a technology product to a human lead service. We had struggled to devise a way we could employ design educators in a way that schools could afford at scale. Similar programs that had been implemented in the past had been successful in that they were enjoyed by teachers and students, but faced major roadblocks in securing funding and ongoing systemic support.</p>


                                <p> Instead of creating an entirely new business that was profit driven - what if we could utilise current students at universities through the creation of a design education subject as a community outreach program? </p>

                                <p> It would provide educational benefits to the tertiary students and fill the gaps that schools were missing in a cost effective way. The university would be incentivised through positive branding and the opportunity to increase student interest in their institution - we could also develop the subject in a way that enables data collection to drive the universities education research goals.
                                </p>

                                <p> To validate our refreshed idea - we again created a mini-pitch and illustrated the concept. Rather than storyboard, we drafted example lesson plans for the school students across different age groups and a subject outline for those at university. We interviewed current design students and found a definite thirst for a community subject of this type but there were concerns about how they would deliver the content - causing us to create a tangible toolkit with the lesson plans and materials required on simple cards and mini-booklets. </p>

                                <p> We then presented our new concept to design educators, education researchers and the universities community outreach centre. It was incredibly well received and they all wanted to know how they could help us get the service beyond an assignment and on the market. They emphasised that for us to secure funding the pitch needed to focus on holistically communicating the experience and this communication needed to impress.
